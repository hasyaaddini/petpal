# 🐾 PetPal — Pet-Safe Recipe Recommender

**Live Demo (Web UI):** [Open in Browser](https://hasyaaddini.github.io/petpal/)  

PetPal is a fun and interactive program for pet owners who want to share meals with their cats or dogs **safely**. Some human foods are toxic to pets, so PetPal provides **pet-safe recipe alternatives** while keeping the food visually similar. It also includes a **mood checker** to suggest activities, treats, or care based on your pet’s behavior.  

The project has **two versions**:  
- **Terminal Version:** Run directly in your command line.  
- **Web Version:** Clickable, pixel-art-style gamelike interface for a playful user experience.
